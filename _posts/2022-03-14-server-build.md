Hey everyone. For a while, I wanted to collect computer parts to 
build my own server. I'm installing the hardware inside an old 
case which I have cleaned and polished. Here is a list of some 
of the components:

- GeForce GTX 1660
- 9th Gen Intel Core i5
- Asus TUF B365M-Plus Gaming Motherboard
- Corsair DDR4 2x16GB Vengeance LPX

The processor and graphics card were leftover from a previous 
build. The Intel chip required an older LGA 1151 series 300 
motherboard. I created a boot usb drive for ubuntu server but 
I still need software to upgrade the bios on my list of todos. 
More updates to follow!
