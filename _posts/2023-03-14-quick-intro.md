Hey, my name is Adam and my dog Woodford is a chocolate lab. 
This week I'll be setting up a home staging server in order to 
deploy & test rails applications. Ruby has been my favorite 
programming language for over 8 years. Hopefully this process 
doesn't take too long. I have to install the hardware inside an old 
case which has to be cleaned and polished. Here is a list of some 
of the components:

- GeForce GTX 1660
- 9th Gen Intel Core i5
- Asus TUF B365M-Plus Gaming Motherboard
- Corsair DDR4 2x16GB Vengeance LPX

The processor and graphics card were leftover from a previous 
build. The Intel chip required an older LGA 1151 series 300 
motherboard. I created a boot usb drive for ubuntu server but 
I still need software to upgrade the bios on my list of todos. 
More updates to follow!
