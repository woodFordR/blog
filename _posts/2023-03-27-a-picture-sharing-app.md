I have decided to create an awesome, simple rails app with postgres, css framework 
tailwindcss, and importmaps for the js imports. 
```
  ruby version 3.2.1
  rails version 7.0.4
```
I'm hoping to have this done by the end of next week since we will be on vacation 
trying to use it .. ðŸ˜Ž.

Right now, I'm in the middle of setting up [devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise). 
Devise requests application config edits during installation:
  - required change in `config/environments/development.rb`
    - `config.action_mailer.default_url_options = { host: 'localhost', port: 3000 }`
  - no-api-required change in `config/routes.rb`
    - `root "dens#index"`
  - no-api-required change in `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb`
    - `<p class="notice"><%= flash[:notice] %>`
    - `<p class="error"><%= flash[:error] %></p>`
The devise docs are organized and easy to navigate. I will be adding the 
omniauth settings once I design the model layer.

I was having an issue with setting up psql due to databases, users having 
capital letters from the name of my application ðŸ˜’. My favorite commands so far: 
  - `DROP ROLE ...`
  - `DROP DATABASE ...`
In the future, my plan is to create a postgresql container and an app container. 
Scripts need to be written in these Dockerfiles depending on how deployment to 
my **in-progress** server project.
