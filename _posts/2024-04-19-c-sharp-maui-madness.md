## Stepping back outside your comfort zone
I recently came across an opportunity to develop an app or 2 with [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang). I know 
very little about the language other than it became open source thanks to 
Microsoft in 2014. It's compiled down to machine code which makes [C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang) 
very quick and efficient. I'll be using the [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui?WT.mc_id=dotnet-29192-cxa) 
framework, a multi-platform app ui. Very nice designs, I ran through a couple tutorials in the beginning to understand 
what all the hype is about and is it real. Software folks can be extremely opinionated over programming languages, I've heard 
some hate over the years towards PHP and Laravel! I never understood why but now I think I owe it to society to find out for 
myself and others. 


## This is getting ugly
The documentation over at Microsoft quickly becomes outdated. I don't know how many releases they do for VSCode during the year, 
but I'm getting the feeling nothing works because it's changing too fast. The instructions on how to install every little extension was 
tedious and painful to navigate. I had multiple browser windows full of same instruction except versions were off each time. because I kept going in circles trying to install the environment  
while going through the tutorial. I have not loaded the app onto the google vm that displays a google pixel phone. Mobile development 
is also new to my skills. A long time ago I took a course teaching how to make android applications. It was fun but very basic. Some of 
these pain points can be solved with better information.
