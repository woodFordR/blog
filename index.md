#### In this den, we love the taste of fresh coffee in the morning as Woodford finds some dewey branches to bite. Woodford is orginally from Virginia and it was a long 15 hour drive to bring him home to Lexington, KY. I've been a software engineer for over 8 years. I have worked with many languages and frameworks such as Python, FastAPI / Flask, Javascript, React, etc. Ruby and Rails are still my favorites. Jekyll is great too! Hopefully you can find something interesting in our world. More updates to come and refactors to commit. Enjoy.
